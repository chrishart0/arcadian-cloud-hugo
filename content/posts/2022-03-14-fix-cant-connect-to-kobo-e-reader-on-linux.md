How to fix not being able to connect to Kobo e-reader on Linux.

I've owned a Kobo Forma for a few years now and I love it. My biggest issues with the device always come from trying to connect to it to upload new books. Of course, I never connect it to wifi, I just upload PDFs I've downloaded and Epubs from [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

## I can't connect to my Kobo e-reader Linux

This is a frequent issue for me. It seems like every time I go to plug my Kobo e-reader in it doesn't connect properly and I do it infrequently enough that I don't always have everything I need ready.

## The resolution for not being able to connect

It seems to always be one of two things:

- Need to try another USB cable
- Use a different USB port

I'm not up to speed on hardware enough to understand the issue but that's really it. Grab a few USB cables and make sure you are trying different ports. If you're still struggling I've read other people online mention factory resetting their e-reader.

## Other musings on my Kobo e-reader

I really love this device. It's one of my favorite tech purchases I've made. I'm certainly reading a lot more since I've gotten it. I decided to go with the Kobo brand because of the ease of managing non-proprietary e-books, the only sort I have. I decided to get the Kobo Forma because of the size and physical buttons. At the time I bought it I thought the waterproofness was neat, but I've never actually founds that feature useful. Click on my link below to see it on Amazon.
