ACSM stands for "Adobe Content Server Manager" and refers to a file format used by Adobe Digital Editions, a piece of software used for managing and reading ebooks.

## What is an ACSM file really?

![](/images/InfoGraphicOnWhatIsAnACSMFile.webp)

ACSM files are used to download and activate ebooks from digital libraries and online bookstores such as the [Rakuten Kobo Store](https://www.kobo.com/us/en). When an ACSM file is opened with Adobe Digital Editions, the software contacts an Adobe server and uses the information in the ACSM file to download and unlock the corresponding ebook, which is then saved in the EPUB or PDF format. ACSM files are not the actual ebook content, but rather a kind of "key" that allows the user to access and download the ebook from a remote server.

### Is an ACSM file an ebook?

Nope, as stated in the section above, an ACSM file is really just a link and key to an ebook.

## Why do ebook stores and libraries use ACSM format?

ACSM files are digital rights management (DRM) protected files that are typically used by ebook services to control access to their digital books. The main advantage of using ACSM files is that they help to protect the copyright of the book's content, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to copy or distribute the book without permission. This can help to ensure that the book's creators and publishers are able to monetize their work and are compensated for their efforts.

### Why it's so frustrating when ebook services use ACSM format

The most frustrating thing about using ACSM files is that they are difficult for users like you and me to access and manage. We pay good money for a ligitametly purchased ebook and then they try to lock us into their services. These are really intended to be used on ereaders that connect to the internet, if that isn't you then you are a second class citizen. For example, users need to install Adobe's proprietary special software on their devices in order to open and read ACSM files, and they need to be connected to the internet in order to activate the DRM protection. This is inconvenient for users and may limit their ability to access the book in certain situations, such as when they are offline or have limited internet connectivity.

Another potential disadvantage of using ACSM files is that they can limit a user's ability to use and customize the book to their liking. For example, users may not be able to easily highlight or annotate text, or may not be able to adjust the font size or layout of the book to their preference. This can make it less enjoyable for some users to read the book, and may reduce their overall satisfaction with the ebook service.

## How to convert an ACSM file to an epub?

There are a series of online converters but I can not vouch for them as I was too sketched out to try any of them.

### Convert an ACSM file to epub on Linux

Since ACSM files require the Adobe Digital Editions application, this is tricky. You've got to emulate the Adobe Digital Editions application first, then use it to download the epub with the ACSM file. I have a detailed article on this process linked below.

## Concluding thoughts about what is an ACSM file and why ebook stores use them

So what is an ACSM file? ACSM files aren't an ebook, they are just a link to download an ebook + the key which can only be used in Adobe Digital Editions software or on your ereading devices / apps. Overall, the use of ACSM files by ebook services can provide some benefits in terms of copyright protection, but is very frustrating for end users like you and I.
