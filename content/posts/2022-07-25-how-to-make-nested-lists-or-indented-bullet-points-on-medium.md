Nested lists, also called indented bullet points, are critical to writing good technical content. Medium does not support nested lists but here is my hack.

## First, make a list

In a new block type the _\*_ character then hit space.

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Second, make the “nested” item

Go to the end of the line for one of your existing bullets, then type shift+enter, then past this character –

- Item one  
    – Nested item
- Item two  
    – Nested item
- Item three  
    – Nested item
- Item four
- Item five  
    – Nested item  
    – Nested item
- Item six
