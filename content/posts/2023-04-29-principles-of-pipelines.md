**WIP**: This is a work in progress. I intend to start keeping notes of the basic theory, as I experience and learn it, of how to create a good CI/CD for delivering software.

## Version control:

Ensure all code and configuration files are stored in a version control system like Git. This allows tracking changes, collaboration, and easy rollback of changes if needed.

## Automated builds:

Automate the process of building the software to ensure that the code is always in a deployable state, minimizing integration issues and detecting problems early.

## Continuous integration:

Integrate code changes frequently, at least once a day, to detect issues early and reduce the time it takes to find and fix bugs.

## Automated testing:

Implement various levels of automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure that the code is of high quality and meets the requirements.

## Continuous delivery:

Automatically deploy every change to a production-like environment after passing all the automated tests, allowing for quicker feedback and faster iterations.

## Infrastructure as code:

Manage infrastructure and configurations using code and version control to achieve consistency, repeatability, and scalability.

## One Artifact, One Pipeline, One Path to Production:

## Monitoring and observability:

Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability tools to track the performance and health of the application and infrastructure, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Feedback loops:

Establish feedback loops between development, operations, and business teams to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with business goals.

## Collaboration and communication:

Promote a culture of collaboration and open communication between development, operations, and other stakeholders to break down silos and increase efficiency.

## Automate Security and compliance:

Integrate security and compliance practices into the CI/CD pipeline, including automated security testing and code analysis, to ensure that the application meets regulatory requirements and is secure from potential threats.

## Scalability and resilience:

Design the pipeline to support scalability and resilience, enabling the application to handle increased load and recover quickly from failures.
