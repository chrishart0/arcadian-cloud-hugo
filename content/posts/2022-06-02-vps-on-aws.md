## Does AWS offer VPS?

First lets answer this question, does AWS offer VPS? Yes! AWS does offer VPS via a service called Lightsail. Amazon Lightsail is a managed VPS service which provides you with an easy interface to deploy a cheap VPS at the click of a button.

## Services to Deploy a VPS on AWS

There are two services you can use to deploy your VPS: Lightsail and EC2. Lightsail is the VPS service AWS provides ready made, giving you over a dozen options for types of software to deploy. EC2 is more barebones.

## Using EC2 as Your VPS

AWS EC2 offers a much more advanced experience. EC2 is one of the first services offered by Amazon and is designed to provide virtual machines on-demand. The power of EC2 comes from its flexibility. EC2 is designed to provide servers at scale, billing per second so that you only pay for what you use.

### EC2 Free Tier

EC2 offers a 1 year free tier for t2 and t3 micro servers. The t3.micro is a 2 vCPU, 1 GB of memory server.

### EC2 Pricing for VPS

You'll find EC2 pricing for VPS is not very competitive. Excluding the generous free tier, on-demand pricing

Check the EC2 on demand prices yourself here: [https://instances.vantage.sh/](https://instances.vantage.sh/). This site is much easier to use than the official pricing guide, which can be found here: [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)

#### Several ways to buy EC2

There are a few billing models for EC2

**On Demand:**

- Pay per the second

- Ideal for servers which you intend to turn off, such as a small game server for friends that won't be used 24/7

**Reserved**:

- For a discount, you can commit to reserve an EC2 instance. There are several ways to reserve, but the essence is the longer you reserve the cheaper it is, and the higher % you pay up front the more you save

#### Deploy Your VPS on EC2
