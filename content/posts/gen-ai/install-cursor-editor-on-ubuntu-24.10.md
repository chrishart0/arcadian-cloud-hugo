### How to Install Cursor on Ubuntu 24.10

**Quick Answer**: Head to the [Cursor homepage](https://www.cursor.com), download the AppImage, make it executable, and run it. If you want it to show up in your app menu, add a `.desktop` entry.

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor, and getting it up and running on Ubuntu 24.10 is pretty straightforward. Here's how to do it:

#### Step 1: Download the AppImage
Go to the [Cursor homepage](https://www.cursor.com) and grab the Cursor `.AppImage` file for Linux. This AppImage is a self-contained package that makes installation hassle-free.

#### Step 2: Make the AppImage Executable
After downloading, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where the `.AppImage` is, and run:

```bash
chmod +x cursor-0.42.2x86_64.AppImage
```

*Note: Replace `cursor-0.42.2x86_64.AppImage` with the actual filename, likely there will be a different version number by the time you read this.*

#### Step 3: Run the AppImage
Launch Cursor by running:

```bash
./cursor-0.42.2x86_64.AppImage  --no-sandbox
```

If you run into a security warning related to AppArmor, you might need to create an AppArmor profile to get it running.

#### Step 4: Optional - Desktop Integration
If you want Cursor to be accessible from your app menu, you'll need to create a `.desktop` entry. There's a script available on the Cursor forum that can handle this for you—updating symlinks, downloading the icon, and creating the `.desktop` file. You can find the script [here](https://gist.github.com/arpagon/7cb8ff6361380725c893f5535fbbb58d).

You can also try this AppImage Launcher:

#### What Makes Cursor Cool?

Cursor is built to be an AI-first code editor, similar to GitHub Copilot but fully integrated. It helps with auto-completion, code generation, and debugging—basically, it aims to make coding faster and less of a slog. If you hit any bumps during installation, especially with AppArmor, the [Cursor Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com) is a great place to find solutions other users have shared.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **AppArmor Issues**: If Cursor doesn't launch, you might need to create an AppArmor profile. Check out the detailed guides on the [Cursor Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com).
- **Desktop Integration**: To make Cursor easier to launch, set up a `.desktop` file so it shows up in your applications menu.
