"_Cloud Infrastructure are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards... Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the infrastructure engineer works out his resource allocation in relation to the load which he is facing.

He who can modify his memory and CPU in relation to his level of saturation and thereby succeed in cost savings, may be called a heaven-born DevOps Engineer."_

“_He will win who knows when to self manage k8s and when not to self manage k8s._”
