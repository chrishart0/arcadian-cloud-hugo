Périgord France, steeped in ancient history, full of haunted castles and enchanted forests.

I often listen to instrumental music while working. While listening to a Dungeon Synth playlist, a particular favorite genre for working to, I came across an album called Patrim_ò_ni by ElixiR. Reading the comments I found out the whole album was dedicated to a South Western region of France called Périgord. Hear about the castles, knights, ghosts very much peaked my interested so I am using this as an excuse to lean more about this region.

## Castles, Knights, and Such

There are over 1,000 castles in the region. That works out to about 1 castle per 415 people, a pretty good ratio.

[Here is an interactive map](https://www.perigord.com/en/liste/chateaux/) of castles and Châteaus in the area, many of which are open for public visits.
